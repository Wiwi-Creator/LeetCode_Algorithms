Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [1,3,6,10]

Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]

Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].

#  02. Jewels and Stones
```markdown

# 771.
# With Python
# Difficuly : Eazy

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels,
and stones representing the stones you have. 
Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. 
You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

● 1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
● jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
● All the characters of jewels are unique.

#  03. Maximum Ice Cream Bars
```markdown

# 1883.
# With Python
# Difficuly : Medium

It is a sweltering summer day, and a boy wants to buy some ice cream bars.

At the store, there are n ice cream bars. You are given an array costs of length n,
where costs[i] is the price of the ith ice cream bar in coins. 
The boy initially has coins coins to spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as possible. 

Return the maximum number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with coins coins.

Note: The boy can buy the ice cream bars in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: costs = [1,3,2,4,1], coins = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: The boy can buy ice cream bars at indices 0,1,2,4 for a total price of 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: costs = [10,6,8,7,7,8], coins = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: The boy cannot afford any of the ice cream bars.
Example 3:

Input: costs = [1,6,3,1,2,5], coins = 20
Output: 6
Explanation: The boy can buy all the ice cream bars for a total price of 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 18.
